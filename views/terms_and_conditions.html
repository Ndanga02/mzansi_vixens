            government-issued photo identification, and possibly a copy of a recent
            bank statement for the credit or debit card used for the purchase. We

            <h2>16. Severability</h2>
            <p>All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be
                exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that
                they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited
                to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement
                illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any
                provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or
                unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of
                the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall
                constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof,
                and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full
                force and effect.</p>

            <h2>17. Dispute resolution</h2>
            <p>The formation, interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and
                any disputes arising out of it shall be governed by the substantive and
                procedural laws of Guernsey without regard to its rules on conflicts or
                choice of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of Guernsey. The
                exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject
                matter hereof shall be the courts located in Belize, and you hereby
                
                submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any
                right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or related to this
                Agreement. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
                International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</p>

            <p>Ads on our platform must be true images of YOU and YOU must be a
                person of 18 years old or older. We do regular spot checks of member’s
                age verification &amp; identify and any ad that we suspect is falsifying their
                identity or under age will be asked for immediate proof. This can be
                done using the appropriate ID or passport page. During this period
                your ad may be suspended.
                All Ads placed on our site are checked on submission and monitored
                periodically. If they do not adhere to our terms and conditions, they will
                be removed with no notice.</p>

            <h2>22. Report Ad</h2>
            <p>If you wish to report content that is violating your image rights or
                information you can email using our Contact Us page. We will then
                proceed to verify the information in question and investigate any
                
                account / profile / ad of a reported case to us. We will delete any
                suspected account / profile / ad of the person breaching the T&amp;C’s .
                We reserve the right to remove or modify any content or image/s, and
                suspend or remove any user found breaching our T&amp;C. Therefore, we
                will not refund any payments after the suspected account / profile / ad
                is removed from our advertising platform.
